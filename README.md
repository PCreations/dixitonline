Dixit Online side project

On the frontend side I need :
 - to retrieve a query result
 - to subscribe to change on this query result
 - to apply the query reducer for optimistic update if needed

On the backend side I need :
 - to retrieve the stored query result
 - to react to events to update the stored query result
 - to notify subscribers for changes
