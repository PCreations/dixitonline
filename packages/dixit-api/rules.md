# Dixit rules :

## Setup

 - 3 to 6 players
 - One cards deck
 - 6 cards by player
 - One player is selected as the storyteller. She becomes the first in the player's list, other players are listed randomly.

## Game round

 - The storyteller selects one card from her hand, and write down a short sentence, or simple word, to describe the card. The description should not be to easy, nor to hard to find.
 - Each player selects the card from her own hand that best fits the storyteller's description.
 - The 6 cards are shuffled, then showed to all players
 - Each player (but the storyteller) secretly votes for the card she think is the storyteller's card

## Points

 - If nobody or everybody finds the correct card, the storyteller scores 0, and each of the other players scores 2.
 - Otherwise the storyteller and whoever found the correct answer score 3
 - Players score 1 point for every vote for their own card.
 - An other round starts with the next player in the list as the storyteller.

## Game end

 - The game ends when a player reachs 30 points or when the card deck is empty.
